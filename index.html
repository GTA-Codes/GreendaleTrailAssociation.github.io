        The Greendale Trail Association is an organization that helps fund a new Greenbelt Trail System. The
        Greenbelt Trail System is developed in order to enhance pedestrian and cyclist safety across the
        Village, improve connectivity to existing pedestrian and bike infrastructure both within and outside the
        Village, attract cyclists to visit Downtown Greendale businesses, and provide expanded opportunities for
        diverse transportation options. The Trail would connect Greendale points of interest to the regional Oak
        Leaf Trail, a popular multi-use trail system across Milwaukee County.
